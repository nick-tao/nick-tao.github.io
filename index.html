					Editing HTML and CSS code can be done without any specific tools. In fact, if you have a simple text editor, you are good to go. However, just because you can do something doesn’t mean it is the best way to do it – and that applies to web development as well.

				<p class="normal">
					<a href="http://lighttable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light Table</a>      is a reactive work surface for the creation and exploration of apps or programs. It’s a quite unique web development IDE based on a simple idea that people need a real work surface to code on rather than just using an editor.
				<p class="normal">
					With Light Table, you can move things around, keep clutter down, bring information to the places you need it most etc. In addition to that, Light Table is a standalone app and you can run it just like any other editor you have been using so far.
				</p>
				<p class="normal">
					Here are the guiding principles of this cool web development IDE:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You don’t have to look for documentation</li>
					<li>Files are not the best representation of code, just a convenient serialization</li>
					<li>Trying is encouraged – changes produce instantaneous results</li>
					<li>Trying is encouraged – changes produce instantaneous results</li>
					<li>We can shine some light on related bits of code</li>
				<ul>

			</div>
			<div class= "sectionRight">
				<h3> Pros</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Inline evaluation: you don't have to re-compile your whole source file. Each time you want to see an output, all you have to do is hover your cursor over the line you'd like to evaluate and press ctrl+enter; LT will evaluate that line of code for you.</li>
					<li>The "Watches" feature lets you see your code running live as you type it. This means that you can debug your code live while writing it, which leads to considerably less programming errors.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3> Cons</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>No autocomplete Functions, Git integration or customizable syntax highlighting</li>
					<li>Sometimes unexpected closures when the project in development is very large</li>	
					<li>Not super user friendly & lacking options </li>
				</ul>
